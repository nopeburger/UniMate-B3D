"""Text-guided motion editing via replacement-style flow-matching inference.

Given a clean ground-truth motion ``x1_known`` and a list of joint names to
hold fixed, clamp those joints to GT for all frames while letting the flow
ODE denoise the remaining joints under a new text prompt. Example: fix the
lower body of a walking clip and ask the model to add an upper-body action
("walking while waving").

Mask shape is ``(B, J, 1, 1)`` — broadcasts uniformly over feature dim D and
time T, since whole joints are kept across the entire clip. The underlying
ODE sampler (``inbetween_sample_ode``) is shape-agnostic, so the replacement
math is the same as in-betweening; only the mask differs.

Joint names are resolved per-case against
``motion_dataset.cond_dict[object_type]``, matching **either** vocabulary:
the rig's own bone names (``Bip01_L_Thigh``) or the cleaned ones stage 3
produces (``Left Thigh``). Cleaning is a per-element string transform that
preserves joint order, so an index found through either list points at the
same joint row the model was conditioned on via ``joint_names_emb`` (which
is built from the cleaned names — see ``dataset.model_joint_names``).
