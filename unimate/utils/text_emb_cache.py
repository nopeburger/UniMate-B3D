"""On-disk cache of text-encoder features.

The dataset pre-encodes every unique caption and joint name at construction
time, which means loading a text encoder onto the GPU and running it on every
run — seconds of startup and several GB of VRAM for a model that is thrown away
immediately afterwards. Caching those features next to the features removes
both: with a complete cache the encoder is never instantiated at all.

**Per-token, not pooled.** Each text is stored as its ``(T_i, D)`` sequence of
non-padding token features, because ``text_cond='cross_attn'`` needs the
sequence — a pooled vector would leave its cross-attention attending a single
token, i.e. a more expensive adaLN. The pooled vector ``adaLN`` wants (the
mask-weighted mean the encoder computes) is stored beside the tokens as
``pooled``, the encoder's own number: a mean recomputed from the stored float32
rows would differ from it in the last bits.

A caption key carries an embedding and a mask: ``emb`` is padded to the file's
longest sequence and ``mask`` marks its real tokens. ``load_cache`` returns
each key trimmed by its own mask, so the padding lives in the file (where zlib
compresses it away — a padded file is ~1% larger on disk) and never in RAM,
which is where it would actually cost: truebones captions are 42% full, so a
resident padded array would be 107 MB against 45 MB, and objaverse's 1.2 GB
against 431 MB.

Up to three files per feature directory, flat beside ``captions.json`` —
captions and joint names are separate sources with very different shapes (a
caption is ~13 tokens, a joint name ~2), and only one of them changes when
captions are re-annotated::

    dataset/features/<ds>/caption_emb_cache.npz  one entry per CLIP KEY, i.e.
                                                 the keys of captions.json
        keys  : (N,) unicode        the clip key to look up by
        emb   : (N, T_max, D) f32   per-token features, right-padded
        mask  : (N, T_max) bool     True on this key's real tokens
        texts : (N,) unicode        the caption each entry encodes (optional)
        pooled: (N, D) f32          the encoder's pooled vector (required)

    dataset/features/<ds>/caption_generic_emb_cache.npz   the same, for the
                                                 generic captions of
                                                 captions_generic.json
    dataset/features/<ds>/caption_detail_emb_cache.npz    the same, for the
                                                 detail captions of
                                                 captions_detail.json

    dataset/features/<ds>/joint_emb_cache.npz    one entry per UNIQUE joint name
        keys : (N,) unicode        the joint name
        emb  : (N, D) f32          the pooled vector, no mask

    both:
        meta : () object           {'encoder_type', 'encoder_version',
                                    'emb_dim', 'format', 'pooled'}

Joint names are stored pooled because that is all the model ever sees of them:
``joint_names_emb`` is one vector per joint. Captions keep their sequence
because ``text_cond='cross_attn'`` attends it; ``adaLN`` reads their stored
``pooled`` vector.

**Stale entries.** Keys are clips, so a caption edited after the cache was
built would otherwise keep its old embedding. A file that stores ``texts`` is
checked on load against the current captions (``load_cache(..., texts=...)``):
an entry whose text differs is dropped, i.e. treated as a cache miss and
re-encoded. Files without ``texts`` cannot be checked; they are used with a
warning, and ``precompute_text_emb`` rebuilds them in full.

The encoder is not part of the filename, so ``meta`` is the only thing standing
between a t5 cache and a clip run: ``load_cache`` refuses a file whose recorded
encoder is not the one being asked for, alongside the format-version and
dimension checks.

Written by ``unimate/tools/precompute_text_emb.py``; read by the mixture
dataset. A missing or partial cache is never fatal — the dataset encodes
whatever the cache does not cover.
