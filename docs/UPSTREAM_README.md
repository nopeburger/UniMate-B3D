## 🛠️ Environment Setup

All components share a single conda environment, specified in [`requirements.txt`](../requirements.txt):

```bash
conda create -n unimate python=3.10 -y
conda activate unimate
pip install "setuptools<81"
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-build-isolation
```

## 📊 Dataset & Data Processing

We introduce **UniML3D**, a large-scale dataset of 13,769 text-paired motion clips on 7,430 skeletons covering diverse skeletal topologies — bipedal, quadrupedal, avian, marine, insectoid, serpentine, and articulated rigid objects — all brought into a unified canonicalization.

The raw source assets are available on the Hugging Face Hub (collected under [UniMate](https://huggingface.co/collections/Linzhan/unimate)): [Mixamo-Animations-Characters](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linzhan/Mixamo-Animations-Characters), [Objaverse-XL-Rigged-Animated](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linzhan/Objaverse-XL-Rigged-Animated) and [Truebones-ZOO-Annotations](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linzhan/Truebones-ZOO-Annotations) (prompts, metadata and renders only). The Truebones ZOO animal motions themselves are a commercial asset pack whose license does not permit redistribution — please purchase the pack directly from [Truebones](https://truebones.com) and rebuild the per-clip layout with the build scripts in Truebones-ZOO-Annotations.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/dataset_overview.png" alt="UniML3D dataset overview" width="100%">
</div>

The processed dataset is on the Hub as [UniML3D](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linzhan/UniML3D): the exported clips with all captions and annotations, the training-ready features, and canonical rest-pose meshes (everything except the Truebones motions and meshes). See [`data_process/README.md`](../data_process/README.md) for the full data processing pipeline that turns the raw assets into UniML3D (download → export → rendering → captioning → joint annotation → feature extraction → animation).

## 🏋️ Training

Training reads the canonicalized clips under `dataset/features/<dataset>/`. Download them, or build them with stage 4 of the [data-processing pipeline](../data_process/README.md#stage-4-extract) (the Truebones clips must be built from the purchased pack):

```bash
hf download Linzhan/UniML3D --repo-type dataset --local-dir dataset \
    --include "features/*" --exclude "features/*/videos/*" --exclude "features/*/tpose/*"
```

Runs are configured by the JSON files in [`configs/`](../configs/).

<details>
<summary><b>Config naming</b> — <code>{dataset}_{frames}frames_{attention}_{text_cond}.json</code></summary>

8 configs: 4 data combinations x 2 model variants, all at 60 frames.

| Prefix | Training data |
|--------|---------------|
| `uniml3d_*` | Full UniML3D dataset (Truebones + Mixamo + Objaverse) |
| `truebones_*` / `mixamo_*` / `objaverse_*` | A single source |

| Length | `dataset.max_motion_length` |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| `60frames` | 60 frames per clip |

| Suffix | `model.attention` x `model.text_cond` |
|--------|---------------------------------------|
| `_graph_adaln` | `graph` x `adaln` — attention factored into spatial (per frame) and temporal (per joint) passes with graph-distance, edge-type and depth biases; the caption is folded into the adaLN modulation |
| `_full_cross_attn` | `full` x `cross_attn` — one attention over the flattened joint x time tokens; the caption enters every block as cross-attention keys/values |

The two axes are independent and all four combinations are implemented, so `full` x `adaln` and `graph` x `cross_attn` also run if you set them in a config; the two shipped pairings are the ones the paper compares.

Tuned per data combination: `training.batch_size` (16 / 32 / 24 / 16 for Truebones / Mixamo / Objaverse / UniML3D), `training.num_steps` (80k / 120k / 100k / 120k), `model.num_layers` (6 / 6 / 8 / 10) and `dataset.max_joints` (100 / 100 / 60 / 70; `dataset.min_joints` is `5` everywhere). The joint range bounds the skeleton sizes a run admits (object types outside it are dropped) and, through what survives, the joint-axis padding width. Mixamo is a single skeleton, so its configs also turn off the object-type balancing (a no-op with one type) and, by choice, the topology augmentations.

The `uniml3d_*` configs train the recommended model's recipe: fixed per-dataset sampling weights (`dataset.sampler_dataset_weights`), one normalization pool across datasets (`dataset.use_dataset_stats: false`), the generic and detailed captions drawn with probability 0.35 and 0.25 besides the normal one, and logit-normal flow time (`training.t_sampling`). The single-source configs keep per-dataset statistics, the normal caption and uniform flow time.

</details>

Launch with [🤗 Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate). Single GPU:

```bash
accelerate launch -m unimate.training.train --config configs/uniml3d_60frames_graph_adaln.json
```

Multi-GPU on one node (e.g. 8 GPUs):

```bash
accelerate launch --num_processes 8 -m unimate.training.train --config configs/uniml3d_60frames_graph_adaln.json
```

<details>
<summary><b>Options and run outputs</b></summary>

`scripts/run_train.sh <config> [-- extra args]` wraps the single-GPU command with the conda environment activated, the GPU with the most free memory selected, and anything after `--` forwarded to the training module.

`--output_dir`, `--batch_size`, `--num_workers`, `--resume <checkpoint.pt>` and `--stats_path <dataset_stats.npy>` override the config from the command line. Resuming restores model, EMA, optimizer, LR-scheduler and step counter, and reuses the run's `dataset_stats.npy`, so a run continues exactly where it stopped. `--stats_path` loads normalization statistics from a file instead of computing them, e.g. to fine-tune a model on new data in the normalization it was trained with.

Each run writes to `outputs/<experiment name>/`:

| Path | Content |
|------|---------|
| `config.json` | Resolved config, including the auto-computed `max_joints` / `max_depth`; inference reads it back to rebuild the model |
| `dataset_stats.npy` | Normalization statistics, reused at inference |
| `checkpoints/checkpoint_step_*.pt` | Model, EMA, optimizer and LR-scheduler state, every `training.save_interval` steps |
| `debug/` | Sample visualizations, rendered once before training and at every checkpoint (EMA weights, `sampling.cfg_scale`) |
| `logs/` | TensorBoard scalars (`tensorboard --logdir outputs/<experiment name>/logs`) |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What a training step does</b></summary>

Clips are drawn by a power-law-balanced sampler when `training.balanced` is set — a type with `n` clips is sampled in proportion to `n^(1-sampler_alpha)`, so at the default `sampler_alpha = 0.5` a species with 100 clips is seen ten times as often as one with a single clip rather than a hundred times; with `dataset.sampler_dataset_weights` each dataset first gets its fixed share — then augmented on the fly — joint addition, leaf removal, chain pooling and per-bone length perturbation (`dataset.use_*_aug`) — so the model sees more topologies than the data literally contains. Every clip is padded to `max_joints` on the joint axis and `max_motion_length` on the time axis, with masks carried alongside; nothing padded ever contributes to attention or to the loss.

Training is **flow matching** (`training.diff_model = "flow"`): the network predicts the velocity of a linear interpolant between noise and data, under a masked L2 loss plus two auxiliary terms computed on the reconstructed clean motion — a geodesic rotation loss (`training.lambda_geo`) and a velocity-smoothness loss (`training.lambda_smooth`). Conditioning is dropped with probability `model.cond_mask_prob` so the same weights serve the conditional and unconditional branches that classifier-free guidance interpolates at sampling time. AdamW with a cosine schedule and warmup, gradient clipping at `training.max_grad_norm`, and an EMA copy of the weights (`training.use_ema`) — the copy inference loads by default.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Pre-computing text embeddings</b></summary>

The text encoder (`google/flan-t5-base` by default) is fetched from the Hugging Face Hub on first use. Every run loads it once to embed all captions and joint names; pre-computing those embeddings beside the features keeps it out of the run entirely:

```bash
python -m unimate.tools.precompute_text_emb --config configs/uniml3d_60frames_graph_adaln.json
```

This writes `caption_emb_cache.npz` (and `caption_generic_emb_cache.npz` / `caption_detail_emb_cache.npz` for the other two captions) and `joint_emb_cache.npz` into each `dataset/features/<dataset>/` the config uses. Captions are cached per token (the sequence `cross_attn` attends; `adaln` mean-pools it), joint names as one pooled vector each, keyed by the **cleaned** joint vocabulary that stage 3 produces — the shared naming is what lets the same anatomical joint embed identically across rigs. Re-run it after regenerating captions or joint names: anything the cache misses is still encoded at load time, so a stale cache costs speed rather than correctness.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Troubleshooting</b> — unstable training on Objaverse</summary>

A non-trivial share of the Objaverse-XL rigs and clips are defective: rest poses that lie flat, are rotated or are inverted, and clips that stitch several unrelated actions together. Training on them can destabilize or collapse a run, and isolated spikes in the training loss are usually a symptom of bad data rather than of optimization.

To localize the problem, first train on Mixamo and Truebones alone — set `dataset.dataset_list` to `["truebones", "mixamo"]` in a copy of a config. If that run is healthy, the fault is on the Objaverse side. From there, inspect the skeleton preview videos of the suspect object types under `dataset/features/objaverse/videos/`, by eye or with an automated pass, and add the offending rigs and clips to the stage-4 skip lists that [`tools/patch_annotations.py`](../data_process/README.md#stage-3-joint-annotation) maintains.

</details>

## 📌 Note

The processed **UniML3D** dataset is [released](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linzhan/UniML3D). Its captions were **re-processed** for this release, so they do not necessarily match the prompts shown on the project page or in the paper. See the released caption style in [Truebones](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linzhan/UniML3D/blob/main/export/truebones/motion_captions.json) · [Mixamo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linzhan/UniML3D/blob/main/export/mixamo/motion_captions.json) · [Objaverse](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linzhan/UniML3D/blob/main/export/objaverse/motion_captions.json). New prompts start with "An object" to generalize across objects.

UniMate is an **early step** toward text-to-animation for any skeleton, and many motions and skeletons **still fail**. We believe that scaling up training data — **distilled from agents or generated from videos** — is a promising direction to close this gap. If you run into failure cases, please open an issue or contact us; they help us improve.

## 🎬 Inference

Given a rigged 3D asset and a text prompt, UniMate generates articulated motion for arbitrary skeletons in real time — with no per-skeleton retraining and no test-time optimization.

**1. Get a model.** Download a [released checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/Linzhan/UniMate) (configuration, normalization statistics, latest checkpoint), or use the output directory of your own training run:

```bash
hf download Linzhan/UniMate --repo-type model --local-dir outputs \
    --include "unimate_uniml3d_f60_v3_preview/*.json" --include "unimate_uniml3d_f60_v3_preview/*.npy" \
    --include "unimate_uniml3d_f60_v3_preview/checkpoints/checkpoint_step_100000.pt"
```

**2a. Animate a dataset skeleton.** Download [UniML3D](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linzhan/UniML3D) into `dataset/` (≈ 88 GB; its [dataset card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Linzhan/UniML3D#download) shows smaller partial downloads):

```bash
hf download Linzhan/UniML3D --repo-type dataset --local-dir dataset
```

Then name skeletons as `<dataset>:<object_type>` (`truebones:Horse`, `mixamo`, `objaverse:<uid>`). For example, Garfield, a Gundam, Baymax and a flower from Objaverse-XL, the Mixamo humanoid and a Truebones reindeer ([`assets/examples/examples.json`](../assets/examples/examples.json)):

<details>
<summary><code>assets/examples/examples.json</code></summary>

```json
[{"asset": "objaverse:01fcb4e4c36548ca86624b63dfc6b255", "id": "garfield-dance", "prompt": "An object dances in place."},

```

</details>

```bash
python -m unimate.inference.sample --exp_dir outputs/unimate_uniml3d_f60_v3_preview \
    --test_cases_json assets/examples/examples.json --num_repetitions 3 --output_dir outputs/samples/examples
# drive each skeleton's canonical mesh: one animated GLB + FBX per motion
# (Truebones meshes are not distributed; SKIP_INVALID=1 skips motions without a mesh)
SKIP_INVALID=1 bash scripts/run_animate_motion.sh outputs/samples/examples
```

`--asset <refs> --prompt <prompts>` samples every prompt on every asset without a file. Motions are written to `--output_dir` (default `<exp_dir>/samples`); runs into the same directory add to it, and `run_animate_motion.sh <dir>` drives them all. Training captions, good prompts to start from, are in `dataset/features/<dataset>/captions*.json`. Mesh driving checks first that motion, conditioning and mesh share one joint order.

**2b. Animate your own rigged asset.** [`rig_preprocess`](../data_process/rig_preprocess/README.md) turns a rigged GLB / glTF / FBX, animated or not, into an asset directory that `--asset` takes. It labels the joints with an LLM and stops so you can review the labels and the facing pair before building, since the model is conditioned on both; its [guide](../data_process/rig_preprocess/README.md) walks through the review and every option. Three assets processed this way are in [`assets/examples`](../assets/examples): a Unitree Go2 quadruped, an eagle and a shark:

```bash
python -m unimate.inference.sample --exp_dir outputs/unimate_uniml3d_f60_v3_preview --asset assets/examples/unitree_go2 \
    --prompt "An object trots forward." "An object rears up on its hind legs." --output_dir outputs/samples/custom
python -m unimate.inference.sample --exp_dir outputs/unimate_uniml3d_f60_v3_preview --asset assets/examples/eagle \
    --prompt "An object flaps its wings." "An object strikes forward." --output_dir outputs/samples/custom
python -m unimate.inference.sample --exp_dir outputs/unimate_uniml3d_f60_v3_preview --asset assets/examples/shark \
    --prompt "An object swims and turns around." "An object bites forward." --output_dir outputs/samples/custom
bash scripts/run_animate_motion.sh outputs/samples/custom   # each asset's mesh, animated
```

<details>
<summary><b>Prompting</b></summary>

Prompts matter. Write short captions in the style of the training captions (`dataset/features/<dataset>/captions*.json`): start with "An object" and describe one motion, not the character ("An object flaps its wings.", not "A blue parrot flaps its wings in the sky."). The closer a prompt is to that style, the better it is followed. Samples vary, so generate several (`--num_repetitions`) and try a few phrasings. `--cfg_scale` (default 3) sets how strongly the prompt is followed: raise it (5 to 7) when a prompt is ignored, lower it for smoother, calmer motion.

</details>

## 🎨 Applications

The same trained model does three more tasks with no extra training. Each is replacement-style sampling: part of the motion is pinned to a known signal and the flow ODE denoises only the rest at every step, so the constraint holds exactly rather than being encouraged by a loss.

### Motion in-betweening

Hold chosen keyframes at their ground truth and generate the transitions between them.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/motion-in-betweening.png" alt="Motion in-betweening" width="100%">
</div>

<details>
<summary><b>How to run it</b></summary>

`--keep_frames` takes signed indices (negatives count back from the generation window), so `"0,-1"` fills in everything between a clip's first and last pose.

```json
{ "mixamo-Air_Squat-000": "An object squats and then stands up." }
```

```bash
KEEP_FRAMES="0,-1" bash scripts/run_sample_motion_inbetween.sh \
    outputs/unimate_uniml3d_f60_v3_preview cases.json
```

</details>

### Text-guided motion editing

Hold chosen joints at their ground-truth motion for every frame and regenerate the rest under a new prompt — keep what should stay, re-animate the rest.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/motion-editing.png" alt="Text-guided motion editing" width="100%">
</div>

<details>
<summary><b>How to run it</b></summary>

`--keep_joints` matches case-insensitively against either the rig's own bone names or the cleaned vocabulary.

```json
{ "mixamo-Cocky_Head_Turn-000": "An object walks forward." }
```

```bash
KEEP_JOINTS="Neck,Head" bash scripts/run_sample_motion_edit.sh \
    outputs/unimate_uniml3d_f60_v3_preview cases.json
```

</details>

### Motion expansion

Chain several prompts into one long motion. The first segment is generated freely; every later one pins its first few frames to the previous segment's tail, and the segments are stitched at the seam.

<div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/motion-expansion.png" alt="Motion expansion" width="100%">
</div>

<details>
<summary><b>How to run it</b></summary>

Test-case values become *lists* of prompts, one per segment; `--expand_overlap` sets how many frames consecutive segments share.

```json
{ "mixamo-sequence": ["An object stands up.", "An object walks forward.", "An object turns around in place."] }
```

```bash
EXPAND_OVERLAP=10 bash scripts/run_sample_motion_expand.sh \
    outputs/unimate_uniml3d_f60_v3_preview cases.json
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Shared behaviour</b></summary>

Each mode writes into its own subdirectory of `--output_dir` (`inbetween/`, `motion_edit/`, `motion_expand/`) alongside a small JSON recording the constraint that produced it, and each has a wrapper in `scripts/` — run any of them with `-h` for the full option list.

In-betweening and editing clamp against a real clip, so their test-case keys must be `<object_type>-<clip_id>` naming a clip on disk: a dataset clip under `dataset/features/<dataset>/motions/`, or one of a `rig_preprocess` asset saved with `--save_clips`; that clip's motion is saved beside the result as `<case_id>-gt_rep_<r>-<i>.npy` for side-by-side comparison. `--gt_start_frame` pins which window of the clip is used instead of a random one. Editing trims both the sample and the GT to the clip's true length, while in-betweening generates the full window and trims only the GT — so align the two on frame 0 rather than assuming equal lengths. All three modes need `--cfg_scale > 1.0` and are mutually exclusive with each other.
