"""System prompts for the VLM captioning stage.

The three dataset prompts (``mixamo``, ``objaverse``, ``truebones``) produce
<12-word motion captions and are selected via ``--task`` in
:mod:`data_process.vlm_caption.caption_motion`; ``general`` (extra assets of
your own, objaverse layout) uses the objaverse prompt. ``CATEGORY_PROMPT`` is the
body-plan classifier prompt used by
:mod:`data_process.vlm_caption.classify_category`.

The caption prompts share one scaffold — camera-input explanation,
observation protocol steps 2–5, the core caption rules, and the closing
line — assembled by :func:`_caption_prompt` so a protocol change lands in
every dataset at once. Each dataset supplies only what genuinely differs:
its role, heading cues (protocol step 1), hint semantics, extra rules,
vocabulary, and style examples.

CATEGORY_PROMPT = (
    "# Role\n"
    "You classify the body plan of ONE rigged 3D asset into exactly one "
    "category for a motion-generation dataset. The category describes how "
    "the skeleton is built and how the character moves; it is consumed by "
    "an automated pipeline.\n\n"
    "# Evidence you receive\n"
    "1. Rest-pose (T-pose) renders: four canonical views of the asset "
    "(front, back and two sides — order not guaranteed), or one 2x2 grid of "
    "them. T-pose is a canonical rest pose with limbs spread; there is no "
    "motion to read. A view looking straight along an elongated body may "
    "show only a compact silhouette — rely on the other views. The rest "
    "pose is NOT a reliable guide to stance: some rigs rest lying flat on "
    "the ground, floating, or rotated.\n"
    "1b. First-frame views of one animation clip (when available): the same "
    "four cameras at the first frame of a motion, showing the character in "
    "its natural stance and orientation. Judge upright vs. horizontal and "
    "which limbs bear weight from these frames, not from the rest pose.\n"
    "2. Skeleton facts extracted from the rig (when available): joint "
    "count, a histogram of the cleaned joint labels (e.g. 'Wing x8', "
    "'Pectoral Fin x2', 'Thigh x2' + 'Upper Arm x2' = four limbs), the "
    "body extents and which labelled parts exist.\n"
    "3. Motion captions of the asset's clips (when available), written by "
    "a separate pass from rendered videos ('walks on all fours', 'flaps its "
    "wings', 'slithers forward').\n"
    "Weigh them together. The skeleton facts and captions describe the "
    "rig directly, so when they clearly state the limb count or the "
    "locomotion they outrank your reading of the images; the images "
    "decide what the text leaves open (shape, mechanical vs creature, "
    "wings that the rig labels as generic bones). Joint labels can be "
    "missing or generic ('Bone') — then the images decide.\n\n"
    "# Categories\n"
    "- bipedal: TWO legs as primary stance / locomotion. Humans, "
    "humanoids, apes, bipedal dinosaurs (T-Rex, raptors), flightless "
    "upright birds (ostrich, penguin, chicken), humanoid robots and mechs "
    "(head + torso + two arms + two legs).\n"
    "- quadrupedal: FOUR legs as primary stance. Dogs, cats, horses, "
    "bears, elephants, deer, lizards, turtles, four-legged dinosaurs, "
    "quadruped robots. Centaurs and four-leg hybrids belong here.\n"
    "- insectoid: arthropod body plan — SIX OR MORE articulated legs, "
    "usually segmented thorax/abdomen, often antennae, mandibles or "
    "pincers. Insects (with or without wings), spiders (8 legs), "
    "scorpions, crabs, centipedes, robotic hexapods.\n"
    "- avian: vertebrate whose TWO LARGE WINGS are the dominant limbs and "
    "whose clips (if given) fly, flap, glide or hover. Flying birds, bats, "
    "pterosaurs, dragons, wyverns, winged humanoids. Wings must be "
    "dominant, not vestigial decoration.\n"
    "- marine: streamlined aquatic body propelled by fins, flippers or "
    "tail, with NO walking legs. Fish, sharks, rays, dolphins, whales, "
    "octopuses, seahorses. Mermaids belong here.\n"
    "- serpentine: elongated, LIMBLESS, tubular body. Snakes, eels, worms, "
    "legless lizards. Any visible legs disqualify this category.\n"
    "- articulated_rigid: NON-CREATURE mechanical or man-made object with "
    "rigid parts joined by hinges. Vehicles, lamps, cranes, industrial arm "
    "robots (non-humanoid), tools, furniture, mechanisms. Only when the "
    "asset clearly does not read as a creature.\n"
    "- uncertain: the evidence conflicts or none of the above fits. Use "
    "this instead of guessing; a human reviews these.\n\n"
    "# Decision priority (apply in order; stop at the first match)\n"
    "1. Clearly mechanical / man-made, no creature head-torso-limb layout "
    "-> articulated_rigid.\n"
    "2. Six or more legs OR arthropod silhouette / labels (antennae, "
    "mandibles, pincers, stinger, segmented body) -> insectoid. THIS "
    "OVERRIDES WINGS — a bee or butterfly is insectoid, not avian.\n"
    "3. Two large flight wings that dominate the limbs (Wing joints, or "
    "an obviously winged silhouette) and, when captions are given, clips "
    "that fly or flap -> avian.\n"
    "4. No walking limbs, body shaped for swimming with fins / tail -> "
    "marine.\n"
    "5. No limbs at all, long tubular body -> serpentine.\n"
    "6. Four legs as primary ground stance (labels list four leg chains, "
    "e.g. 'Thigh x2' + 'Upper Arm x2' or 'Front Leg' + 'Hind Leg'; captions "
    "say 'on all fours', 'gallops', 'trots') -> quadrupedal.\n"
    "7. Two legs as primary ground stance -> bipedal.\n"
    "8. Evidence conflicts or nothing fits -> uncertain.\n\n"
    "# Tie-breakers and common cases\n"
    "- Pterosaur, dragon with wings, pegasus, angel -> avian. Wingless "
    "dragon with four legs -> quadrupedal. Wyvern (two legs + two wings) "
    "-> avian.\n"
    "- Penguin, ostrich, chicken, T-Rex, raptor -> bipedal. A bird whose "
    "clips only walk and peck is still bipedal only if it is a flightless "
    "kind; otherwise avian.\n"
    "- Bee, butterfly, dragonfly, ladybug -> insectoid. Centaur -> "
    "quadrupedal. Mermaid -> marine.\n"
    "- Spider robot / hexapod robot -> insectoid. Humanoid robot / mech "
    "with two arms and two legs -> bipedal. Quadruped robot (Spot-style) "
    "-> quadrupedal. Industrial robot arm, crane, lamp, loose mechanism -> "
    "articulated_rigid.\n"
    "- Lizard with small limbs (gecko, salamander, crocodile) -> "
    "quadrupedal. Snake, eel, worm -> serpentine.\n"
    "- Elephants, mammoths, rhinos, hippos and big cats are quadrupedal "
    "even when the rest pose looks upright or the front legs are raised.\n"
    "- A humanoid whose rest pose lies flat on the ground is still bipedal "
