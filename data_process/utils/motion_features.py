"""Per-object motion feature extraction (export NPZ → canonical clips).

Pipeline:
    1. ``process_tpose``            — load / canonicalize the T-pose, compute
                                      scale + rest offsets.
    2. ``build_topology_cond``      — build the per-object topology condition
                                      dict (joint graph, spectral feats, …).
    3. ``load_and_canonicalize_motion`` + ``trim_static_ends``
                                    — load / normalize each motion, strip
                                      static pre/post-roll.
    4. ``extract_clip_feats`` + ``save_clip``
                                    — slice into clips, dump per-frame arrays
                                      (positions / rotations / facing) and an
                                      MP4 visualization.

``process_object`` orchestrates 1–4 for one object type and returns an
``ObjectResult`` (see below) summarizing the saved artifacts.

Output layout under ``save_dir``:
    motions/{object}-{motion}-{clip_idx}.npz   # per-clip per-frame arrays
